# Python Data Analyses and Visualization applied to European city data

An introductory tutorial for Python data analyses.
The goal of this tutorial is not to solve an important data science problem. For this, anyways, the presented data is too small. The goal is to use an intuitive dataset to learn Python, intuitive in the sense that it contains data that everyone can understand without prior domain knowledge. It should therefore be suitable for someone who is a starter in Data Science.

The Jupyter notebook *City-script.ipynb* can be found in the Github repository.
